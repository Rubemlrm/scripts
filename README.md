# scripts

installation_protonbridge - This script allows you to automatically install all the necessary packages so that the installation of the protonmail bridge goes smoothly. In addition to the protonmail-bridge package, the installation of gnupg is required to create a key associated with the email, as well as using the pass manager, so that they can work with the thunderbird client.
The script is still very basic and will only work on distributions that support .deb packages
